A cycle GAN code which converts summer images into winter. Made this one since I did not get any appropriate dataset for the actual task -XGAN.
The model has got some errors after I tried to sophisticate it, still submitting since I want to rectify it.

I worked in kaggle environment so there might be some of the dependencies needed to be installed while working in google colab or other environments.

The dataset has been attached.
